Bank Customer Churn Prediction - Tensorflow, Keras, ANN
Businesses like banks that provide service have to worry about the problem of 'Churn' i.e. customers leaving and joining another service provider. It is important to understand which aspects of the service influence a customer's decision in this regard. Management can concentrate efforts on the improvement of service, keeping in mind these priorities.

Objective
Given a Bank customer, build a neural network-based classifier that can determine whether they will leave or not in the next 6 months.

Data Description
The case study is from an open-source dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains 10,000 sample points with 14 distinct features such as CustomerId, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, etc.
